# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Start the program
### Step 2: 
Provide the values for x1,x2
### Step 3: 
Provide the values for y1,y2
### Step 4: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula - ((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
### Step 5: 
Execute the program
### PROGRAM:
`````

import math

x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2
d=math.sqrt(((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2))
c=round(d,2)
print(c)
`````

### OUTPUT:
